## Wins & Loses:
### Hidden Media Player
Media Players are notoriously unable to be customized. I was very proud that I was able to use a very ugly, but incredibly stable media player and hide it, giving functionality over to the material-ui Media Control Card. 



_____
###Radio List Component
Returns Hardcoded Monthly Top Picks when the user loads the app or conducts a failed search; Otherwise it returns the data from the API.

 ### Broken Links
 I was not able to figure out a reliable way for the application to check whether a station URL was alive or dead coming from the API.

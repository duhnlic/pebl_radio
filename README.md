Although the structure of Pebl is as small as a pebble, this radio application opens the user up to 30,000 worldwide radio stations as well as the curation of the folks behind the app. Curated stations are separate from the mass search engine and allow the user to save them to a personal profile that they can create in the app.

### App summary:
Pebl Radio's functionality allows the user to search any kind of radio station as well as select from a curated list of stations they can add. Once a user finds a station they like and want to listen to it, it can be played in app.

## Wins & Loses:

### Hidden Media Player
Media Players are notoriously unable to be customized. I was very proud that I was able to use a very ugly, but incredibly stable media player and hide it, giving functionality over to the material-ui Media Control Card. I was very proud that on the second iteration of the app design and functionality, I was able to set up a turnery condition that allowed for a pause icon to display when the user pauses the media playback.

### Three.js
Three JS is a 3D rendering framework built entirely out of JavaScript. It was implemented on this application as a new technology and therefore came with a large learning curve. Through trial and tribulations, the stable background image you see, along with its responsiveness, are due to the 3D environment that was created.
